    m "He followed signs of Kotonoha's path until well after the sun had started coming back up."
    m "Taking all other timestamps into account, that means he was at it for at least five hours."
    m "He took several pictures of the places he passed as he went, but eventually, there was nothing left to even resemble anyone passing through before."
