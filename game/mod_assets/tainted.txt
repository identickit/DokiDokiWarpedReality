#   I should probably keep track of what all mods are active now.
#   Let me write down which ones Monika put in the folder.

#   You know, it would be fun to write one of those “thank you” notes
#           or whatever they call them.

It’s been both fun and an honor to be able to go through with this project. 
Being able to represent so many creators and their works in one mod was something I’ve wanted to do for a while now, so I’m grateful I got to create WR. 
I can’t thank the creators of the mods listed below enough for their remarkable work as well as the creators of the first three mods listed for allowing me to give their stories representation in the form of dialogue references, names, and even characters (more to be featured/referenced in the next chapter!). 
I also want to thank the incredible programmer of this mod, Chino. 
They took this story and made it a reality, and for this I’m forever thankful. 
Finally, thank you to everyone who is reading this — whether you’re watching a playthrough, playing the mod yourself, or reading this somewhere else — for your time! 
I hope you’re doing well and have a great rest of your day.
