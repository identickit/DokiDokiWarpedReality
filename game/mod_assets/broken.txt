Thank you all for your patience as the next part of the DDMC Celebration! project has been in development. It’s been incredibly fun working on this mod so far, and I’m so excited that it’s already come this far. Being able to feature some of the great mods from all across the DDLC modding community is a great honor that I don’t deserve to have, but I’m glad that I have that honor.
Hopefully this first act has given you a pretty good idea of what’s in store for the remaining acts of Broken Reality! If you have any questions regarding the mod, feel free to reach out to me and I’ll answer however I can. ^-^
With that being said, thank you so much to the programmer of this mod, Chino, for all of their hard work! I’m still eternally grateful for their contributions.
Thanks as well to the new members of our development team: SuperSandwich, nikicha, and w3ryfrate. They've been helping a lot with making the development process go a little faster and just enjoyable overall to have on the Tiny Waffle Studios team.
Thank you to everyone who plays this mod and/or watches a playthrough of it! I hope you all are having a good day.
Finally, thank you to the respective creators of all of the mods featured in Celebration! thus far! Your work is amazing and this mod wouldn’t exist without the great stories they tell.
