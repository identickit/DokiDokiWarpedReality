    mc "But firsts are a reason to be proud of ourselves."
    mc "Even if you can only run a few yards before falling or stopping, you made it as far as you did and can keep practicing if you want to go further."
    mc "If you don't do something right in class, you can see where you went wrong and learn for future reference."
    mc "As for writing a poem... Well, it's my first time doing that as well."
